DUE TO NEW YORK CITY'S TRADE TIES TO THE SOUTH, THERE WERE NUMEROUS SOUTHERN SYMPATHIZERS IN THE EARLY DAYS OF THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR AND THE MAYOR PROPOSED SECESSION. FAR FROM ANY OF THE BATTLES, NEW YORK ULTIMATELY SENT THE MOST MEN AND MONEY TO SUPPORT THE UNION CAUSE. THEREAFTER, THE STATE HELPED CREATE THE INDUSTRIAL AGE AND CONSEQUENTLY WAS HOME TO SOME OF THE FIRST LABOR UNIONS.

DURING THE 19TH CENTURY, NEW YORK CITY BECAME THE MAIN ENTRY POINT FOR EUROPEAN IMMIGRANTS TO THE UNITED STATES, BEGINNING WITH A WAVE OF IRISH DURING THEIR GREAT FAMINE. MILLIONS CAME THROUGH CASTLE CLINTON IN BATTERY PARK BEFORE ELLIS ISLAND OPENED IN 1892 TO WELCOME MILLIONS MORE, INCREASINGLY FROM EASTERN AND SOUTHERN EUROPE. THE STATUE OF LIBERTY OPENED IN 1886 AND BECAME A SYMBOL OF HOPE. NEW YORK BOOMED DURING THE ROARING TWENTIES, BEFORE THE WALL STREET CRASH OF 1929, AND SKYSCRAPERS EXPRESSED THE ENERGY OF THE CITY. NEW YORK CITY WAS THE SITE OF SUCCESSIVE TALLEST BUILDINGS IN THE WORLD FROM 1913–74.

THE BUILDUP OF DEFENSE INDUSTRIES FOR WORLD WAR II TURNED AROUND THE STATE'S ECONOMY FROM THE GREAT DEPRESSION, AS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS WORKED TO DEFEAT THE AXIS POWERS. FOLLOWING THE WAR, THE STATE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT SUBURBANIZATION AROUND ALL THE MAJOR CITIES, AND MOST CENTRAL CITIES SHRANK. THE THRUWAY SYSTEM OPENED IN 1956, SIGNALLING ANOTHER ERA OF TRANSPORTATION ADVANCES.

FOLLOWING A PERIOD OF NEAR–BANKRUPTCY IN THE LATE 1970S, NEW YORK CITY RENEWED ITS STATURE AS A CULTURAL CENTER, ATTRACTED MORE IMMIGRATION, AND HOSTED THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW MUSIC STYLES. THE CITY DEVELOPED FROM PUBLISHING TO BECOME A MEDIA CAPITAL OVER THE SECOND HALF OF THE 20TH CENTURY, HOSTING MOST NATIONAL NEWS CHANNELS AND BROADCASTS. SOME OF ITS NEWSPAPERS BECAME NATIONALLY AND GLOBALLYRENOWNED. THE STATE'S MANUFACTURING BASE ERODED WITH THE RESTRUCTURING OF INDUSTRY, AND THE STATE TRANSITIONED INTO SERVICE INDUSTRIES.

THE SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS OF 2001 DESTROYED THE WORLD TRADE CENTER, KILLING ALMOST 3,000 PEOPLE; THEY WERE THE LARGEST TERRORIST ATTACKS ON UNITED STATES SOIL.
